# Fluid-Dynamic-Simulation
## Overview
This program simulates a time-evolving system (Burger's equation for fluid mechanics). The simulation is generated by computing the evolving 2D velocity vector over 2D space at each time step. The evolution considers imposed boundary and initial conditions. The generated vectors are saved as individual frames, which then can be combined to show the evolution.
